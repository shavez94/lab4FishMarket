Dataset description of each column in the dataset:

Species: The fish species is shown in this column. Each fish is categorized into one of seven species using this category variable. Naming conventions for the species may include "Perch," "Bream," "Roach," "Pike," "Smelt," "Parkki," and "Whitefish."The goal of the polynomial regression analysis is to forecast the weight of the fish based on its other features, and this column is the target variable for that study.
Weight: The fish's weight is shown in this column. It's a numerical variable with grams as its standard unit of measurement. We wish to use polynomial regression to predict the weight, which is the dependent variable.
Length1: The fish's length is measured for the first time in this column. It is a numerical variable with centimeters as its usual unit of measurement.
Length2: The fish's second length measurement is shown in this column. It is an additional numerical variable that is commonly expressed in centimeters.
Length3: The third length measurement for the fish is shown in this column. Like the other two columns, it is a numerical variable with a standard measurement of centimeters.
Height: The fish's height is indicated in this column. It is a numerical variable with centimeters as its usual unit of measurement.
Width: The fish's width is shown in this column. Similar to the other numerical variables, its standard measurement is expressed in centimeters.
